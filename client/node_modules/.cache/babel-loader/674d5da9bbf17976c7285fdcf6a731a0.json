Africanists soon broke away to form the Pan-Africanist Congress, which negatively affected the ANC; by 1959, the movement had lost much of its militant support.</p>\r\n                <span className=\"image main\"><img src=\"images/NMsmile.png\" alt=\"\" /></span>\r\n\r\n                <p align=\"left\">But in his fight for total freedom, the liberation leader also devoted himself to another cause -- the empowerment of women. Although Mandela made tremendous strides in his battle to bring down apartheid, he recognized early on in his presidency that no major success was possible without gender equality.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>\"Freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated...</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p align=\"left\">At the opening of the first parliament in 1994, President Mandela declared, \"Freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression... Our endeavors must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.\"\r\n                With the representation of women in South Africa's parliament jumping tenfold from 2.7% during apartheid to 27% after the first democratic elections of 1994, Mandela took action by appointing over a third of women to his cabinet. And today, females make up 44% of the country's politicians -- not far off from the government's goal to reach \"50/50 Gender Parity\" by 2015. In 1995, at the time of drafting South Africa's constitution, he said, \"As a tribute to the legions of women who navigated the path of fighting for justice before us, we ought to imprint in the supreme law of the land, firm principles upholding the rights of women. On International Human Rights Day in December 1996, Mandela signed the final draft of the country's constitution granting South Africa's women one of the most comprehensive set of rights in the world.</p>\r\n                <p align=\"left\">By the 1999 general election, Nelson Mandela had retired from active politics. He continued to maintain a busy schedule, however, raising money to build schools and clinics in South Africa's rural heartland through his foundation, and serving as a mediator in Burundi's civil war.</p>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BodyMA;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
